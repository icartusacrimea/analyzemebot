Normal vampires  Yes  You drink blood too?  And...  You're Goth?  No it looks amazing in general  Hahaha Yes it looks sleek  Vh? Yes portal keeps the messages but k guess that's okay  I'm glad it works for you too!  interesting link hello princess :stuck_out_tongue: al;fkjasdl;jfks hello person from portal how are you doing ? ijijij okok I'm joining now ddd /openportal  See you :slightly_smiling_face: have fun coding ! and thank you for your time in general thanks man I can't wait to test webot as well :smile: this needs a bit of optimization but not right now... I basically only use one line of socket io code :stuck_out_tongue: and yes I'm using socket io just to emit the messages from the slack event api to my front end from the moment it started and on portal saves the chat history not many people will do that though haha true ! and  you will hint those in the help command or let them be hidden for good ? haha awesome ! like ? :hushed: oh man ! what a cool idea !!!! used to be my favorites indeed great games haha good then it works that's where I got the inspiration for both the name and the animation actually :stuck_out_tongue: yes I did hmm yeah so awesome thanks for the tip ! didn't think about the naming at all to  be honest oh even better then :smile: this way the user would click on those imediately portalopen portalclose portalmute ect... well I cold then make all commands start with "portal" what do you mean about that ? you type a lot of stuff for the user I mean well I thought of that but isn't that more complicated ? so any thoughts ? great so now it works as before exactly yes that's how it works yup! seems like it's working no one did :wink: hahahah but if  you mute it only posts from the portal appear in slack exactly lol xD I haven't dealt with this yet... interesting that you brought it up try muting the portal from within slack . you do this when you want to say something privetly to the slack members of the channel but you don't want to close the connection with the  portal and to post the message the chatpostMessage method I\m using events api so more than 1 users can use the portal at the same time and connect inside the slack channel that created that particular portal awesome ! that's how I set my username to be and more than one people can join the same portal you like it ? the error of undefined I just need to restart the server :stuck_out_tongue: oh yes I fixed that alrady yes I can ! /openportal  haha didn't really noticed that but yeah :stuck_out_tongue: try opening viewing and using a portal, muting it unmuting it. it's pretty quick shouldn't take more than 2 mins or something to see all the available options so far use the /portalhelp command okay  :smile: welcome ! no one sees anything okay that's good ! hello ? yes it does !</p></html>
